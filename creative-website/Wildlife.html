        <p> Curaçao is home to a wide variety of animals.  Specifically, many species of exotic birds call this island home.  ranging from large brown pelicans, to the small but sweet bananquits, commonly reffered to as the <em>"Sugar Thief"</em>.  Bright yellow orioles and neon green parakeets are just a few of the birds you will see in Curaçao. </p>

     
        <p> In the desert you will find no shortage of iguanas, big and small.  These little lizards are found all over the island, but are most commonly found in the desert and near resorts, as there is a lot of food for them.</p>
       
        <p> The oceans of Curaçao also have their own ecosystems.  Under the water you will find a wide array of colorful fish, of all sizes.  Sea turtles are also a common sight on the right beaches.  Curaçao is one of the best places for snorkeling right off the coast; However, you do need to be wary around rocks.  Sea urchins are hiding in every hole, along with venomous lionfish and barracudas not being uncommon.  Eels are also a frequent find near the shore, some being small and looking like a shoelace, and others large with ferocious teeth.</p>
