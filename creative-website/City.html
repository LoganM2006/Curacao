        <p> The capital of Curaçao, Willemstad, is a relativley small but very lively city.  The city has a large entertainment district, with restaraunts lining the streets, and alleyways with tons of shops. </p>

     
        <p>The city is very walkable, however there are taxis that will take you around from one half of the city to the other.  Because Willemstad is a port city, there is a large drawbridge connection the 2 havles of the city.  This draw bridge opens horizontally, powered by just a couple of motors that push it to the side to open the port.  When the bridge is opened, ferries will make frequent trips from side to side.  There is also a larger bridge that is very high that can be used to cross the port, if you have a car, of course.</p>
      
        <p> The city is fun during the day, but night is when it really comes to life.  Live music is playing nearly wherever you go, the drawbridge is lit up with colorful lights, and the city is teeming with people.</p>
